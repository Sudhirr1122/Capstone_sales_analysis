1.Write an SQL query to find the count of users in each order bucket based on their order history. The order buckets are categorized as 'No_orders' for customers with no delivered orders, '1_to_5_orders' for those with 1 to 5 delivered orders, '6_to_10_orders' for 6 to 10 delivered orders, and '>=10_orders' for customers with more than 10 delivered orders. The result should display the order bucket and the corresponding count of users.

with my_cte as (
select User_id,count()over(partition by User_id) as count_of_total_order
from Capstone_database
)
select
case 
    when count_of_total_order >= 1 and count_of_total_order <= 5 then '1_to_5_orders'
    when count_of_total_order >= 6 and count_of_total_order <= 10 then '6_to_10_orders'
    when count_of_total_order >= 10 then '>=10_orders'
    else null
    end as order_category,
    count(*) as total
    from my_cte
    group by order_category;

4. Calculate the month-over-month retention for a specific cohort based on the month of their first order. The retention should be measured for each subsequent month. The cohort should be defined by the month of the first order, and the result should display the percentage of customers retained for each month. For example, People who ordered for the first time in Jan, what percentage of users ordered in Feb, Mar, Apr and so on. Then same for people who first ordered in Feb, how many of them ordered again in Mar, Apr, May and so on till June.
